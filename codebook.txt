The dataset: Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones Dataset by the Non Linear Complex Systems Lab at University of Genoa, Italy.

Transformations of the dataset are performed with the script run_analysis.R. 
This script imports the Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones Dataset and exports a tidy dataset representing mean measured variables for each subject x activity.
The output dataset is named project_tidy.txt

The output of run_analysis.R is a dataset with the following variables:

Variables:
activity_desc : the physical activity the subject was performing during the trial
subject_id : the subject's id (1 to 30)
activity_id : the numeric code for the physical activity the subject was performing during the trial

The following variables represent the mean value for each subject x activity combination:
tBodyAcc : body acceleration signal 
tGravityAcc : gravity acceleration signal
tBodyAccJerk : body acceleration jerk signal
tBodyGyro : body gyroscope signal
tBodyGyroJerk : body gyroscope jerk signal
tBodyAccMag : body accerlation magnitude
tBodyAccJerkMag : body accerlation jerk magnitude
fBodyAcc : fast Fourier transform of body accerlation signal
fBodyAccJerk : fast Fourier transform of body acceleration jerk signal
fBodyGyro : fast Fourier transform of body gyroscope signal
fBodyAccMag : fast Fourier transform of body acceleration signal
fBodyBodyAccJerkMag : fast Fourier transform of body accerlation jerk magnitude
fBodyBodyGyroMag : fast Fourier transform of body gyroscope magnitude
fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag : fast Fourier transform of body gyroscope jerk magnitude

The variables beginning with 't' and 'f' represent mean, standard deviation (std) and weighted average of frequency components (meanFreq) in X, Y, and Z directions as labeled in variable name
where the 'mean' in the variable names represents the mean for the TRIAL, not for the subject x activity combination.
